# `0`ceanic Theme - TODO: Proper name

**Disclaimer**
My whole theme setup is mostly based on those great themes:
* [Material VS Code Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme)
* [Material Theme for Jetbrains editors](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains)

(they are great, please check them out)
****

## Principles
* Same background for every normal window
* Same (other) background for every popup window
* One accent color for UI accents and other specific elements
* Optional - a second accent color if you want to get fancy
* Flat is the way
* ... but shadows are cool if you want them


## How it looks?
